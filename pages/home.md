# Hi â€” I'm Tymo, an IT student at [InHolland](https://www.inholland.nl/inhollandcom).

I'm current in my final year of school and like to write compilers
as a hobby. Most of my compiler projects are unfinished, but some of
them do produce runnable programs. I mostly program in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), but am trying out other languages such as
[Zig](https://ziglang.org), [Go](https://go.dev) and
[Odin](https://odin-lang.org).

Besides programming I also really enjoy making digital [art](/art). I'm also the
founder of the small record label Cyduck, since then ownership of the label has
been transferred to Dylan (SCTRS) but I am still involved as a regular staff
member.

I also play a lot of games. My favourites include:
[ELDEN RING](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring),
[Warhammer: Vermintide 2](https://www.vermintide.com),
[Honkai: Star Rail](https://hsr.hoyoverse.com),
[Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com),
[Ori and the Will of the Wisps](https://www.orithegame.com),
[Dead Cells](https://dead-cells.com),
[Lies of P](https://www.liesofp.com) and
[Overwatch](https://overwatch.blizzard.com).
